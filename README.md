# NLP / Text mining using Classical ML
## Problem Statement and Business Case : To analyze the twwets and categorize as positive /negative tweets
NLP (Natural Language Processing) works by converting words (texts) into numbers 
These numbers are then used to train the Machine Learning Models to make Predictions
This AI/ML model is crucial for companies to detect their customer reviews fast and efficiently
The dataset contains 1000's of tweets and detects tweet as positive (1) or negative (0)

##About datasets used:

The dataset contains a diverse range of tweets, capturing the opinions, emotions, and attitudes of Twitter users on various topics such as movies, products, events, or general daily experiences. The tweets cover a broad spectrum of sentiments, including expressions of joy, satisfaction, anger, disappointment, sarcasm, or indifference.

## Naive Bayes is a classification technique based on bayes theorem
The theoram works on conditional Probability and Mathematics

PRIOR PROBABILITY --> Probability of assuming before, performing the experiment.

LIKLIHOOD PROBABILITY --> Probability of assuming while performing the experiment.

POSTERIOR PROBABILITY --> Probability by combining both prior and liklihood probability.

Formula of Naive Bayes Theorem:
#    P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * p(A)) / P(B)
